# XHABExtruder
 
An experimental 3D printing extruder tool for an industrial robotic arm developed for the NASA XHAB design studio at Pratt Institute.

This project utilizes the Lily Pellet extruder kit and with a custom controller developed on the Arduino Mega/ ESP32 microcontroller. The robot is programmed in grasshopper to follow printing toolpaths and communicates via IO pulses to sync extruder operation.
